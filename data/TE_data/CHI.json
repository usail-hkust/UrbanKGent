The park is also featured as one of the main settings in the book \"Devil In The White City\" written by Erik Larson. Landscaped with long vistas and avenues of trees at the start of the 20th century, the Midway in part followed the vision of its designer Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the creators of New York City's Central Park, but without his proposed feature of a Venetian canal down the Midway's center linking the lagoon systems of Jackson and Washington parks. Instead, the Midway is landscaped with a fosse, lawn covered depression, where the canal would have been, although in the winter parts of the grounds are turned over for ice skating. The Midway Plaisance has a variety of different elements for visitors to explore, including lakes, trails, bridges, and fields.

At one time joined with neighboring Rogers Park, it seceded to become its own village in 1890 over a conflict concerning park districts (known as the Cabbage War).[2] West Ridge was annexed to Chicago on April 4, 1893, along with Rogers Park.[3]", "geometry value": "POLYGON ((-87.70690177438968 41.983080466543015, -87.70693028354792 41.98314885057625, -87.70750885907549 41.98495283150526, -87.70815606059283 41.98703925877706, -87.70951601308599 41.991612971780384, -87.70985220795463 41.9928098401543, -87.70988804366274 41.9929486440423, -87.71016497484298 41.99402255134173, -87.71034398514217 41.99490443658783, -87.71049568578417 41.99572774938407, -87.71051198551103 41.99582931808041, -87.71062465141323 41.99670244541703, -87.71066884676435 41.99729359212045, -87.7106708951947 41.99736566544772, -87.70901447062371 42.019131106879684, -87.70877084622452 42.01913994240202, -87.7086615358199 42.01914390647527, -87.70849444780902 42.01914891403366, -87.70812665490845 42.019157009898734, -87.707299785007 42.01917489560578, -87.70450358193585 42.01923474658758, -87.6920910205808 42.01949043607064, -87.69044048390259 42.019524397036086, -87.68999118410451 42.01953129218816, -87.68912439120874 42.01952942153588, -87.68629446522463 42.01950763191074, -87.68588219330705 42.01950294689148, -87.68542364309768 42.01949662735943, -87.6846530946559 42.0194847726953, -87.67501250028955 41.99799274710572, -87.6750065483413 41.99789772448122, -87.67499417858912 41.99753451486339, -87.67499127245793 41.99744830318184, -87.67498302192145 41.99720352897369, -87.67497314081436 41.99689870251532, -87.67489095234767 41.99423674991649, -87.67483452087264 41.992077754853014, -87.67484988171721 41.99076157237122, -87.68944833315466 41.98316768591433, -87.69851788234628 41.98312140971855, -87.70690177438968 41.983080466543015))"}

{"entity ontology": "area", "entity name": "SOUTH_SHORE", "geometry type": "polygon", "entity type": "area", "text description": "Like all of what is now the City of Chicago, the South Shore community area was originally inhabited by a number of Algonquian peoples, including the Mascouten and Miami.[3] After the expulsion of Native Americans by white settlers in the nineteenth century, it became characterized by small settlements including Essex, Bryn Mawr, Parkside, Cheltenham Beach, and Windsor Park.[4] The area is bounded by 67th and 79th streets to the north and south and by Stony Island Avenue and Lake Michigan to the west and east. In 1861, the Illinois General Assembly incorporated Hyde Park Township, which included South Shore.[5] The area's population grew as workers in the nearby steel industry settled in the area.[4] Following the June 29, 1889 elections, the South Shore community area was annexed into the City of Chicago with the entirety of Hyde Park Township.[6] The location of the World's Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park prompted the sale of land and building lots. As in other parts of Chicago, the desire for affordable housing at the start of the twentieth century led to the large scale construction of bungalows. Unlike other areas in which bungalows were built en masse, South Shore's bungalow residents were largely affluent.

Although it was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889, it remained mostly farmland with some scattered settlements until the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1930 the population increased from 14,000 to 47,000. Residents of German and Irish descent began to move into the area from the Back of the Yards and Englewood neighborhoods. Poles, Bohemians, and Lithuanians followed them. Most new residents belonged to various Protestant denominations, but Chicago Lawn also was home to many Roman Catholic churches and schools. Today, there are six Catholic institutions that make up the Marquette Park Catholic Campus Council. Chicago Lawn was a thriving urban neighborhood as the Depression hit the nation and by 1940 its population had reached 49,291. In 1941, the National Biscuit Company announced plans to build a huge bakery in Chicago Lawn. When completed, this was the largest bakery in one location in the world.

After the turmoil of four mayoral administrations in a seven-year period, finally, in 1986 during Washington's tenure, the city and the Library Board picked a location and floated a $175 million bond issue to provide funds for the new building, as well as the entire citywide library branch system.[4] In 1987, a design competition was held by the city to decide on the architecture of the library. Five prominent entries were chosen from design-build coalitions of architects and contractors, representing designs by VOA Associates in collaboration with Arthur Erickson; Hammond, Beeby & Babka; Murphy/Jahn, Lohan Associates, and SOM. The entries were narrowed down to two finalists: The Chicago Library Team with Helmut Jahn's glassy, modern design, and the SEBUS coalition, whose postmodern design by Hammond, Beeby and Babka took elements from nearby historic buildings. Notably, Jahn's design was to have arched over Van Buren Street onto the area that is now occupied by Pritzker Park, incorporating a new elevated station on Chicago's Loop. These elements were deemed too expensive, along with the rest of Jahn's design, so the Hammond, Beeby and Babka design won the competition.
