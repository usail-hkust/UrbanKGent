The park is also featured as one of the main settings in the book \"Devil In The White City\" written by Erik Larson. Landscaped with long vistas and avenues of trees at the start of the 20th century, the Midway in part followed the vision of its designer Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the creators of New York City's Central Park, but without his proposed feature of a Venetian canal down the Midway's center linking the lagoon systems of Jackson and Washington parks.

Czech immigrants were the most prominent and named the district after Pilsen (German for Plze≈à), the fourth largest city of the Czech Republic. They replaced the Germans and Irish who had settled there before them, in the mid-nineteenth century. These German and Irish residents lived in poor conditions throughout the 1850s and ‚Äò60s. The Pilsen area was overcrowded and suffered from flooding, lack of indoor plumbing, and illness. A cholera outbreak that killed hundreds, eventually led the German and Irish residents to move in search of better living conditions.[3] The population also included smaller numbers of other ethnic groups from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats and Austrians, as well as immigrants of Polish and Lithuanian heritage. Many of the immigrants worked in the stockyards and surrounding factories. Like many early 20th century American urban neighborhoods, however, Pilsen was home to both wealthy professionals and the working class, with the whole area knitted together based on the ethnicities, mostly of Slavic descent, who were not readily welcome in other areas of the city.[4]", "geometry value": "POLYGON ((-87.68739948177965 41.834800982012965, -87.68745790501902 41.83491310214777, -87.68748711462891 41.835885766258144, -87.68750278533723 41.83642578924513, -87.68751312145936 41.83681210268499, -87.68803384628572 41.8569697648434, -87.68807300499718 41.85933842624856, -87.6742725910317 41.85954587999678, -87.6447639920422 41.85995286606378, -87.64125181582179 41.85999446115234, -87.6390136663112 41.86001802673476, -87.63515815937588 41.857722095253074, -87.63532120104001 41.857225185301075, -87.63549373689112 41.85693837990375, -87.6421818545254 41.850454690830425, -87.64264003998157 41.85002382696834, -87.66614347258322 41.83802670449804, -87.66650632320659 41.83786127426623, -87.66698374185529 41.83766025585764, -87.66762727432106 41.837467086455604, -87.66824256150002 41.83732210384414, -87.66877889423942 41.837228500316236, -87.68739948177965 41.834800982012965))"}

In 1861, the Illinois General Assembly incorporated Hyde Park Township, which included South Shore.[5] The area's population grew as workers in the nearby steel industry settled in the area.[4] Following the June 29, 1889 elections, the South Shore community area was annexed into the City of Chicago with the entirety of Hyde Park Township.[6] The location of the World's Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park prompted the sale of land and building lots. As in other parts of Chicago, the desire for affordable housing at the start of the twentieth century led to the large scale construction of bungalows. Unlike other areas in which bungalows were built en masse, South Shore's bungalow residents were largely affluent. Additionally, Shore Shore was the destination for white flight from Washington Park as immigrants and African Americans moved there.[4]", "geometry value": "POLYGON ((-87.58453754214831 41.75149858871684, -87.58565529834297 41.75150194251394, -87.58582440080069 41.75150555852535, -87.59563037138865 41.758695854376214, -87.59209856900311 41.77327546217088, -87.5664481864219 41.77379108199669, -87.56644657432143 41.77379026414018, -87.56642930912537 41.773781503556144, -87.54432455016928 41.76064918460322, -87.54430661776784 41.76063797450608, -87.54429072059 41.76062518696807, -87.54304101127036 41.759600852367285, -87.54293505366398 41.75950198753134, -87.5406464354047 41.75734556063301, -87.54064631113856 41.75734544314311, -87.54062495261854 41.75732518723558, -87.54060672738429 41.75730510964231, -87.54060159721958 41.75729547415407, -87.54059888186609 41.757290373808395, -87.54059765588845 41.757278194403156, -87.54059675912833 41.75726928325434, -87.54060503101408 41.757246425195355, -87.54062365903383 41.75722775558049, -87.54067019437575 41.75719588607345, -87.54078047536532 41.75712150808993, -87.54494620223834 41.75443515499885, -87.54656290320406 41.75387096447163, -87.55228728194311 41.751918637779504, -87.55228777090542 41.751918630949554, -87.55354936593832 41.751901192323764, -87.56547905353617 41.7517380653869, -87.5669121654082 41.75171876411037, -87.5754393608372 41.75161220853768, -87.58453754214831 41.75149858871684))"}

Upon his election in 1983, Mayor Harold Washington supported the construction of a new central library. After the turmoil of four mayoral administrations in a seven-year period, finally, in 1986 during Washington's tenure, the city and the Library Board picked a location and floated a $175 million bond issue to provide funds for the new building, as well as the entire citywide library branch system.[4] In 1987, a design competition was held by the city to decide on the architecture of the library. Five prominent entries were chosen from design-build coalitions of architects and contractors, representing designs by VOA Associates in collaboration with Arthur Erickson; Hammond, Beeby & Babka; Murphy/Jahn, Lohan Associates, and SOM. The entries were narrowed down to two finalists: The Chicago Library Team with Helmut Jahn's glassy, modern design, and the SEBUS coalition, whose postmodern design by Hammond, Beeby and Babka took elements from nearby historic buildings. Notably, Jahn's design was to have arched over Van Buren Street onto the area that is now occupied by Pritzker Park, incorporating a new elevated station on Chicago's Loop. These elements were deemed too expensive, along with the rest of Jahn's design, so the Hammond, Beeby and Babka design won the competition.

Daley, worried about a tendency of upscale Chicagoans to move to the suburbs, supported the project and told the planning department to make it work. The lakeshore was legally protected, but the city secured the needed legislation and resolved disputes with the Illinois Central Railroad, which originally owned the property. The city extended Randolph Drive into the lake area making the project possible. It was completed in 1962, as one of the largest apartment buildings in the world outside of New York City, with over 900 one-and two-bedroom units. It offered indoor parking, a pool and exercise facilities, a restaurant and a small grocery store. When it opened in 1962 The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper reported that Loop-area apartment towers such as Marina City, a few blocks away, \"caught the city by surprise.\" A near-Loop location permitted one to walk to work at hundreds of office buildings, as well as walking access to the major department stores and theaters. In 1963 it became the first major apartment building in this part of downtown Chicago and started the trend of downtown living so that it is now surrounded by other upscale apartment and condominium buildings.
